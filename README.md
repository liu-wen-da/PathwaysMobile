### Additional information about the project  

**Team LD** will be reponsible to work on the **SCALE *Pathways* Mobile**. The purpose of this project is to provide students with a way to create and manage their academic schedules throughout their college journey. **SCALE *Pathways* Mobile** will be a cross-platform mobile application that aims to address these issues. It will streamline the process of selecting a degree from an institution, tracking oneâ€™s progress through time for their degree, and making adjustments to any hurdles faced. With these solutions, **SCALE *Pathways* Mobile** hopes to take a load off the shoulders of students around the country.

Currently, the project's code is the auto-generated skeleton code provided when creating a React Native project. This is because we are in the design phase of our project. As **Team LD** progresses, this will be updated.
            
            
## Installation


### Prerequisites

* Node.js
* npm
* Xcode (for iOS build)
* Android Studio and App Tools (for Android build)
* React Native for Web, ReactDOM, and @expo/webpack-config (for Web build)


### Add-ons

Currently, there are no add-ons for this project.


### Installation Steps

1. Clone the directory.
2. Next, enter the the `SCALEPathwaysMobileApp` directory, such as by running\
```cd SCALEPathwaysMobileApp```
3. In this directory, run the command below to install the necessary packages from package.json\
```npm install```
4. Now, the project can be run with the following commands to build the project for each respective system.\
For Android,\
```npm run android```\
For iOS, which must be built on a Mac,\
```npm run ios```\
For the web application,\
```npm run web```


## Functionality

At the moment, our app lacks all functionality as it is only auto-generated skeleton code. Once we move on from the design phase and begin implementing features, this section will be updated regularly.


## Known Problems

Some packages have known vulnerabilities which are fixed in later versions. However, they cannot be updated to these later versions at this time because React Native requires the current offending versions in order to work. These vulnerabilites can only be resolved by testing each individual package's updated version for compatability, or when React Native developers update their package version requirements.
