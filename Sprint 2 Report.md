## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Created screen prototypes for main landing pages.
  * Created good navigation pathways for each of our screens.
  * The team worked well together; we filled each other’s blindspots and helped one another.
  * Removed all schedule conflicts, maximizing the amount of time that the team could work together as well as meet with the clients.


Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Package management for the entire project.
   * Git issues (Inconsistent merge schedules and merging many features at once caused us some issues).
   * Coding style needs to be unified among team members.
  
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Flex containers for all of the screens to create consistent user experiences between different phones and landing pages.
   * Firebase Integration.
   * Support for creating and signing in new users from the app.
