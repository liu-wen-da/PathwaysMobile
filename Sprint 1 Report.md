  ### What's New
  * Created a Figma prototype 
  * Created UML diagrams
  * Created skeleton auto-generated React Native app
  
  
  ### Work Summary 
  **Team LD** has created a [Figma prototype](https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2022Spring2023/scale-mobilefullstackapp/blob/main/Documentation/RawDiagrams/Figma_Design.jpg) to simulate how the user interact with the applcation and how the UI could look. The prototype will be changing frequently as a result of the testing we will be doing, for the goal of creating a better interactive applcation. **Team LD** has also designed two UML diagrams for **SCALE *Pathways* Mobile**. The first is a [Component Diagram](https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2022Spring2023/scale-mobilefullstackapp/blob/main/Documentation/RawDiagrams/UML_Component_Diagram.jpeg), which gives a top down overview of how the application's components will communicate with one another. The second is a [Use Case Diagram](https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2022Spring2023/scale-mobilefullstackapp/blob/main/Documentation/RawDiagrams/UML_UseCase_Diagram.jpeg), which depicts how actors will interact with the application. Finally, we have created a base React Native application, which we will iterate upon as per our our project requirements.

  ### Incomplete Issues
  None.
  
  
  ### Code Files for Review
  Only the auto-generated skeleton code has been provided for this sprint from **Team LD** since we are still in the design phase. Thus, there is nothing to review currently.
  
  
  ### Retrosepective Summary 
  *Here's what went well:*
  * **Team LD** was able to consistently find time to meet and work on the documents and tasks at the same time.
  * **Team LD** was able to fill in each other weaknesses.
  
  
  *Here's what we'd like:*
  * Due to some of the members on the team working late shifts, it was a little difficult for them to communicate with the team.
  
  
  *Here are changes we plan to implement:*
  * Plan around that team member's work schedule so that the entire team is better able to work collaboratively.
